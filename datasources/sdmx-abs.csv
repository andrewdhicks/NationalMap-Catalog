The Treasurer, under the Census and Statistics Act 1905, directed the Australian Statistician to collect and publish statistical information from all eligible Australians on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, about their views on whether or not the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry.\n\n



The survey asked just one question: Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?\n\n



Survey materials were mailed to eligible Australians on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll over a two week period from 13 to 25 September 2017. Requests for replacement forms were available from 25 September to 20 October 2017. Eligible Australians were encouraged to complete the survey using the instructions provided and mail it back straight away.\n\n



All survey responses had to be received by 6pm on 7 November 2017.\n\n



#### Definitions\n

- *Federal Electoral Divisions* - Federal Electoral Divisions are administered by the Australian Electoral Commission. They are legally prescribed geographic areas of Australia represented by a member of parliament elected at a House of Representatives election. The Divisions used in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey are the current Federal Electoral Divisions as at 24 August 2017.  Federal Electoral Divisions do not cross State and Territory borders. Note that Jervis Bay Territory is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Fenner, the Territory of Norfolk Island is included in the Australian Capital Territory Division of Canberra and the Territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are included in the Northern Territory Division of Lingiari.\n

- *Eligible participants* - Eligible participants are those enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, or those who made a legitimate application for enrolment, by midnight on 24 August 2017 and were eligible to vote in a federal election as at 24 August 2017.\n

- *Participation* - Participating in the survey means returning a survey response on a paper form, the online form or on the telephone. In some cases the response was unclear and therefore did not contribute to the yes/no outcome.\n

- *Response* - The responses were 'Yes' or 'No' as well as 'Response not clear' where the intended response was not able to be determined.\n

- *Response clear* - A clear response is recorded where the markings on the form can be clearly identified as indicating yes or no to the survey question.\n

- *Response not clear* - Responses where there is not a clear 'Yes' or 'No' recorded. This includes (but is not limited to) forms where both boxes have been ticked, where there is no marks on the form (blank response) or where the question has been changed to make the answer unclear.\n
